# Lyric_Generator

This project produces usable and creative song lyrics based on a database of existing song lyrics we compiled. The lyrics are built by establishing mathematical relations between individual words within a sentence and across multiple sentences. These relations consist of the phonetic distance between given words, the vector space produced by WordToVec algorithm and Markov chain modelling. In the future, we aim to publish this project online for people to use and to get user feedback to further improve the accuracy of our model.

## Getting Started

The main.py file will contain the instructions and sample code runs o show functionality of the program.
